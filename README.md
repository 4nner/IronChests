Iron Chests for Fabric is a simple mod that enhances your Minecraft Gameplay by adding new, upgradable chests, that will allow you to store more items in a single block. \
Each Chest can be upgraded, starting from the Wooden Chest (Vanilla Minecraft). By doing so you will just need to craft a Chest Upgrade, and SHIFT + RIGHT_CLICK the chest you want to upgrade. \
This will avoid the need to break the already placed chest. Do not worry, the chest will keep its inventory. \
